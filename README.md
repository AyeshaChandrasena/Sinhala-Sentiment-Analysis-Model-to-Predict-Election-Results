# Sinhala-Sentiment-Analysis-Model-to-Predict-Election-Results
Comparison of SinBERT, AshenBERTo, Machine Learning based text classification models to map the election results using extracted social media comments.

Objectives 

1. To develop a sentiment analysis model to classify YouTube comments (Informal language)  
2. To develop a method to predict the election results.
3. To contribute a dataset for the community that can be used in Sinhala text analysis tasks.
4. To explore Explainable AI for Sinhala text classification.
